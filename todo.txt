DEPTHS
Pandora's Box - explore the depths and discover funny weapons inside
focus is on variety of weapons, so probably go with action platformer or maybe space shooter
kill big spooky ghosts and demon looking things
maybe get a currency called DEEP POINTS (lol?) that lets you unlock more things from the depths of the box
have the unlock menu show the inside being an endless void with moving shadows and such
maybe just unlock things in between levels? or have it accesible via menu
how does the player interact with all the funny weapons - equip to a hotbar, maybe when you pull weapons out, you don't know what you're going to get?
maybe unlocking things unlocks a bigger pool of weapons to pull, rather than letting you cherry pick what you're using?

alternative ideas: depths of the ocean - dark scary stuff (not sure I want to put that much focus on environment design)

design thoughts:
how should enemies damage the player? running into them and shooting projectiles makes sense, but how the player dodges projectiles depends on platformer vs top-down
should the player be able to aim with the mouse, or shoot straight only, or aim up and down with W and S?
concept idea: explore the depths of space and your mysterious new weapon, Pandora's Box, to defeat alien invaders (or evil robots or something)
maybe have a meter that you can build up to unleash different levels of chaos from the box
